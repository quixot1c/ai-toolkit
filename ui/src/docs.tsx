        Layer Offloading uses the CPU RAM instead of the GPU ram to hold most of the model weights. This allows training
        a much larger model on a smaller GPU, assuming you have enough CPU RAM. This is slower than training on pure GPU
        RAM, but CPU RAM is cheaper and upgradeable. You will still need GPU RAM to hold the optimizer states and LoRA
        weights, so a larger card is usually still needed.

        Differential Output Preservation (DOP) is a technique to help preserve class of the trained concept during
        training. For this, you must have a trigger word set to differentiate your concept from its class. For instance,
        You may be training a woman named Alice. Your trigger word may be "Alice". The class is "woman", since Alice is
        a woman. We want to teach the model to remember what it knows about the class "woman" while teaching it what is
        different about Alice. During training, the trainer will make a prediction with your LoRA bypassed and your
        trigger word in the prompt replaced with the class word. Making "photo of Alice" become "photo of woman". This
        prediction is called the prior prediction. Each step, we will do the normal training step, but also do another
        step with this prior prediction and the class prompt in order to teach our LoRA to preserve the knowledge of the
        class. This should not only improve the performance of your trained concept, but also allow you to do things
        like "Alice standing next to a woman" and not make both of the people look like Alice.

        Blank Prompt Preservation (BPP) is a technique to help preserve the current models knowledge when unprompted.
        This will not only help the model become more flexible, but will also help the quality of your concept during
        inference, especially when a model uses CFG (Classifier Free Guidance) on inference. At each step during
        training, a prior prediction is made with a blank prompt and with the LoRA disabled. This prediction is then
        used as a target on an additional training step with a blank prompt, to preserve the model's knowledge when no
        prompt is given. This helps the model to not overfit to the prompt and retain its generalization capabilities.

        Differential Guidance will amplify the difference of the model prediction and the target during training to make

        it.

        <br />
        The idea is that normal training inches closer to the target but never actually gets there, because it is
        limited by the learning rate. With differential guidance, we amplify the difference for a new target beyond the
        actual target, this would make the model learn to hit or overshoot the target instead of falling short.

        Weight for the ViTPose body proportion perceptual anchor. This loss compares pose-invariant bone-length

    description: (

        Dampens or eliminates the model's ability to learn faces from the training data by downweighting
        the diffusion loss inside detected face bounding boxes. Use this as a standalone setting when you
        want to train on a dataset without memorizing the faces — for example, training a style or clothing
        LoRA while preventing it from reproducing the faces of people in the images.

        0 = no suppression (normal), 0.5 = half face learning, 1 = full suppression (no face learning).

    title: 'Vision Face Embeddings',
    description: (

        Enables an additional CLIP or DINOv2 vision encoder for richer face detail conditioning. Face crops are
        encoded through the vision model and injected as additional conditioning tokens. This captures fine-grained
        visual details (hairstyle, accessories, skin texture) that ArcFace alone may miss.

        Caches per-image person/body/clothing masks (YOLO person detection → SAM 2 silhouette →
        SegFormer-clothes semantic parse). Masks are stored once per image in <code>_face_id_cache/</code>
        alongside face embeddings, then used at training time to weight the diffusion loss by region.
        <br /><br />
        Enabling this alone has no effect on training — you must also set one of the region loss weights

        When enabled, per-pixel perceptual losses (currently the Sapiens normal loss) are masked to the

        original image, person overlay, body overlay, clothing overlay, and full SegFormer parse colormap.
        Useful for spot-checking mask quality on new datasets before training.
        <br /><br />
        Previews live in the job output folder, not alongside the dataset, so they can't be picked up as
        training images. Only runs during the first-time cache pass (cache-hit path is unaffected). Disable

        Weight for a frozen Depth-Anything-V2 perceptor that encourages the generated image's depth map

        multi-scale gradient-matching term — both differentiable through DA2 back to the predicted pixels.
        <br /><br />
        Helps preserve body silhouette, limb separation, and subject-vs-background depth structure when
        identity training tends to flatten or smear the composition. Start with 0.05–0.10. Set to 0 to
        disable. DA2-Small (~25M params, ~50 MB in bf16) is loaded once; with gradient checkpointing it
        adds ~300 MB peak VRAM and ~100 ms per training step.
        <br /><br />
        Requires the first-time pass to cache GT depth maps to <code>_face_id_cache/</code> next to face
        embeddings — similar timing to face caching.

        Where to pull the spatial weighting mask from:

          <li><b>body</b> — uses the cached identity-only body mask (hair, skin, limbs).</li>

        <b>subject</b> is the usual choice: the model still has freedom over background composition while
        depth structure on the subject is anchored. If Subject Masking is not enabled, falls back to full-
        image loss regardless of this setting.
